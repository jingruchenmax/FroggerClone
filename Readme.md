# FroggerClone

This project is a simple clone of the classic Frogger game, built in Unity. It features basic gameplay mechanics where the player must navigate a frog across a busy road and river to reach safety.

## Research Context
This project is a clone created to replicate the Frogger-clone Cuber from the following research article:

The goal is to explore the impact of visual embellishments (juiciness) on player experience, as described in the referenced study.

## How to Run
